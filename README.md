# html-css-
This repository is to be used for practicing and understanding html and css design concepts in order to further understand client-side
development for a career.  Resources include hands-on projects from a college textbook, as well as other online projects found.  
While anyone may use these projects as resources, it is best for the learner (i.e. you) not to use this as a place to find answers.  It is
always best to research the information and learn it yourself.  That being said, hopefully more custom projects will appear here.  Javascript
repository to be made soon.
