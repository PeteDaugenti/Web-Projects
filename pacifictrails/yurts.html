            <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
            <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.  Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and 
            a roof dome that can be opened</dd>
            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.  Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and 
            a sink with hot and cold water.  Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.  It's also helpful to 
            bring a flashlight and sense of adventure!</dd>
