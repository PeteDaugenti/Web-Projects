        <h1>JQuery FAQs</h1>
        <h2><a href="#">What is JQuery?</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>JQuery is a simplified JavaScript library that makes it easier to code using
                JavaScript methods, selectors, event methods, etc. using less lines of code.  It is 
                used in most of the millions of web pages visted each day, and is becoming common 
                and popular to use by professional web developers. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2><a href="#">Why is JQuery becoming so popular?</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>Three reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>It's free.</li>
                    <li>It let's you get more done in less time.</li>
                    <li>All of its functions are cross-browser compatible.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2><a href="#">Which is harder to learn: JavaScript or JQuery?</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>This is a complicated question to answer given that any programming language for 
                first time users will be complex in their own way, meaning that either way it will 
                be tough in the beginning.  Having said that, it would be easier to learn JavaScript 
                first due to JQuery being a library of JS methods.  It would make the learning 
                process much more simplistic knowing what is what in the programming language.
