        <h2><a href="#">What is JQuery?</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>JQuery is the library of some of the most used JavaScript functions
                you'll most likely use in a professional environment.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2><a href="#">Why is JQuery ecomming so popular?</a></h2>
        <div>
            <p>Three reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's free.</li>
                <li>It lets you get more done in less time.</li>
                <li>All of its functions are cross-browswer compatible.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Which is harder to learn: JQuery or JavaScript?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Depends on what you start with.  It may be easier to learn JavaScript
                first because of how JQuery uses JavaScript functions.  Any programming language
                will be difficult for first time coders but once you spend enough time with one the
                rest seem easy to pick up.  It's recommended to learn a language to the fullest 
                extent before working on another (if they serve the same purpose).  For example, you 
                might want to consider learning either JavaScript or TypeScript.  It would be 
                pointless to learn both at the same time.
