# Email Form Submission

**Note** This file will be updated periodically based on the chapters in **Murach's JavaScript and jQuery 3rd edition**.

This folder contains different versions of an email form with submission options and validation using JavaScript.  One of these 
files uses embedded jQuery to do the same function which includes:
- validation for each field
- error messages for fields left empty during submission
- error message for matching email address validation

The "email.js" file is used exclusively with the "index.html" document.  The "emailquery.html" document contains embedded jQuery in the HEAD section and does not use any JavaScript file.  Both documents use the "email.css" file for simplistic stylings used as an example 
for creating a less basic web document.

## Where can I find this?

This application is found in Murach's JavaScript and jQuery 3rd edition book that was purchased for a class at Cuyahoga Community
College.  The "email list" application as it is called in the book is used throughout for reference when coding forms that use scripted 
form validation.  It can also be used as a reference for whenever a form is created of any kind that could include comment boxes.
